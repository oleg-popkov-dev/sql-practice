#### Table creation code

``` sql
CREATE TABLE Manufacturers (
	Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	Name CHAR(50) NOT NULL 
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
	Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	Name CHAR(50) NOT NULL ,
	Price REAL NOT NULL ,
	Manufacturer INTEGER NOT NULL 
		CONSTRAINT fk_Manufacturers_Code REFERENCES Manufacturers(Code)
);
```
